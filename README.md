### A Local Home Page for OSX Web Development

This is a small and simple local home page that automatically lists, and provide links to, your local sites. It's a companion project for a [blog post](http://mallinson.ca/post/osx-web-development) I wrote about setting up your Mac for web development.

**Update**: You can now set a custom port for a directory. Simply add a file to the root of your site with the name '.port8080', for example and the homepage link will automatically append ':8080' to your site.
